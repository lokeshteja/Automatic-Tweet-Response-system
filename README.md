Automated Tweet Response System

This project provides a powerful solution for efficiently managing Twitter customer support by combining real-time data streaming, advanced machine learning, and automated ticket generation to streamline the support experience.

Key Features

Real-Time Tweet Processing: Tweets are streamed in real-time using Spark Streaming, ensuring minimal response delays.
Intelligent Complaint Analysis: A two-stage machine learning process:
Analyzes tweet language to determine the user's sentiment (positive, neutral, negative).
Classifies the complaint into specific categories (e.g., billing issues, technical problems, etc.). Further, NER model is used to identify the different entities like Location etc. from the tweet. 
Automated Ticketing: Based on all these details, the system automatically generates support tickets, routing issues to the appropriate teams.
Data Storage: Processed tweets and support data can be stored in a data lake for future analysis, insights and resolving the customer probelm promptly by our team.

Project Structure

The project is organized into modular components:

Engines: Contains machine learning models and core logic for data processing.
Helpers: Provides supporting functions for tasks like text preprocessing, model evaluation, API calls, and Twitter interaction.

Technologies Used

How It Works

User tweets are streamed in real-time.
Sentiment analysis determines the user's overall sentiment.
The complaint classification model determines the specific complaint category.
NER model is used further to identify different entities 
Based on the results, a ticket is automatically generated and routed appropriately.
Relevant data is stored for future insights and analysis.

Potential Applications

This system can significantly improve customer support efficiency in industries with high social media interaction. It's suitable for:

Customer service departments
